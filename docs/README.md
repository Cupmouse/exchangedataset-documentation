## What Is Different To Other Similar Services

There is several point that we can be proud of...

1. Our dataset could be streamed in raw format which is the original format that messages are sent from exchanges' WebSocket API, which can be used to backtest existing apps and softwares.
2. Our dataset could also be streamed in standarized format which makes development of apps that make use of historical data faster and easier since you don't have to format each exchanges' message and also reduces client load. We all format them for you.
3. Our dataset is pre-filtered in server-side, reducing server to client transfer.
